Topic: Cymatic Mapping of Mantras

This is a course project (specifically for a thesis course cs 3380 at UWO)

When I started this research project, I wanted to combine my passions -- science and yoga -- with this in mind as well as my recent interest in Nada yoga (sound). I dececide to dive into this 
ongoing research of "Is Cymatics just the new version of Yantras and Mantras, or is it different?"

The research paper will also be attached, which provides an in-depth explanation of the topic and the simulation software developed.
